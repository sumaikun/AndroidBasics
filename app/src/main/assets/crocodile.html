        <h1>How Doth the Little Crocodile</h1>
        <h2>by Lewis Carroll</h2>
        <h2>from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</h2>

        <p>How doth the little crocodile<br/>
            Improve his shining tail,<br/>
            And pour the waters of the Nile<br/>
            On every golden scale!<br/>
            <br/>
            How cheerfully he seems to grin,<br/>
            How neatly spreads his claws,<br/>
            And welcomes little fishes in<br/>
            With gently smiling jaws!</p>
